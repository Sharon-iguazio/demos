# XGBoost Classification with Hyperparameters (Iris Data Set)

This demo demonstrates how to implement a popular machine-learning use case &mdash; binary classification on the Iris data set &mdash; and run model training in parallel with hyperparameters.

The demo injects the Iris data set, runs parallel [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io) model training with hyperparameters, and automates the model deployment.
